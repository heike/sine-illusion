{\bf Re: Submission to JCGS}\\

Dear Professor Lee,

Please find attached our latest revision of "Signs of the Sine Illusion - Why we need to care". We have addressed the typos and grammatical errors noted by one of the reviewers and have also shortened the paper significantly. As a result, we did not have room to include a head-to-head comparison of the dual-plot approach versus the corrected approach suggested in the reviews. However, we feel the space constraints of this publication (which are common) provide an additional example of a situation in which multiple graphs may be inappropriate.

We hope that this revision adequately addresses your concerns as well as those of the reviewers.
